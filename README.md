# Ohara
An extensive database of the most popular manga across multiple generes and demographics that allows for easy viewing of the best titles in each genre.

## Overview
This project queries a PostgreSQL database of manga to perform multiple tasks, such as finding the 100 highest rated titles in a specific genre or finding a specific manga based on a specific descriptor, while also having a clear UI.  
It was created with the aim to simplify the functionality of similar databases such as MyAnimeList such that it would be significantly easier to discover different manga, while also having a clearer and less cluttered layout compared to something like MyAnimeList, making it even simpler and easier to discover new titles.  
  
### Features
- An extensive database of over 2000 manga titles
- A simple yet clear sidebar that allows the user to access different pages that contain the 100 highest rated manga in a specific genre, demographic, or other selector
- A search bar to assist in finding a specific title
- A simplistic layout that helps highlight the different titles while avoiding congestion

## Technologies Used
This project was created with:
- Kaggle, used for finding a .csv file containing over 2000 manga titles from MyAnimeList
- PostgreSQL version 15-3.1
- Django
